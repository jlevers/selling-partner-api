     * @param  ?string  $boxId  The ID provided by Amazon that identifies a given box. This ID is comprised of the external shipment ID (which is generated after transportation has been confirmed) and the index of the box.

     * @param  ?string  $trackingNumberValidationStatus  Indicates whether Amazon has validated the tracking number. Because shipment validation is asynchronous, tracking IDs might not be validated immediately, and the status might change after a few hours. If more than 24 hours have passed and the status is not yet 'VALIDATED' or `NOT_SUPPORTED`, verify the number and update it if necessary. **Possible values:** `VALIDATED`, `NOT_VALIDATED`, `NOT_SUPPORTED` (Amazon is unable to find tracking information for the provided tracking ID).
