     * @param  ?float  $subscriberAverageRevenue  The average revenue per subscriber of the program over a period of past 12 months for sellers and 6 months for vendors. Applicable only for the `PERFORMANCE` `timePeriodType`.
     * @param  ?float  $nonSubscriberAverageRevenue  The average revenue per non-subscriber of the program over a period of past 12 months for sellers and 6 months for vendors. Applicable only for the `PERFORMANCE` `timePeriodType`.

     *
     *  **Note**: The `listOfferMetrics` operation only supports a time interval which covers a single unit of the aggregation frequency. For example, for a MONTH aggregation frequency, the duration of the interval between the startDate and endDate can not be more than 1 month.
     * @param  ?string  $currencyCode  The currency code in ISO 4217 format.
