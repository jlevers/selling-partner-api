    /**
     * @param  string  $sellerFulfillmentOrderId  A fulfillment order identifier that the seller creates to track their fulfillment order. The `SellerFulfillmentOrderId` must be unique for each fulfillment order that a seller creates. If the seller's system already creates unique order identifiers, then these might be good values for them to use.
     * @param  string  $displayableOrderId  A fulfillment order identifier that the seller creates. This value displays as the order identifier in recipient-facing materials such as the outbound shipment packing slip. The value of `DisplayableOrderId` should match the order identifier that the seller provides to the recipient. The seller can use the `SellerFulfillmentOrderId` for this value or they can specify an alternate value if they want the recipient to reference an alternate order identifier.
     *
     * The value must be an alpha-numeric or ISO 8859-1 compliant string from one to 40 characters in length. Cannot contain two spaces in a row. Leading and trailing white space is removed.
     * @param  \DateTimeInterface  $displayableOrderDate  Date timestamp
     * @param  string  $displayableOrderComment  Order-specific text that appears in recipient-facing materials such as the outbound shipment packing slip.
     * @param  string  $shippingSpeedCategory  The shipping method used for the fulfillment order. When this value is `ScheduledDelivery`, choose Ship for the `fulfillmentAction`. Hold is not a valid `fulfillmentAction` value when the `shippingSpeedCategory` value is `ScheduledDelivery`.
     * @param  Address  $destinationAddress  A physical address.
     * @param  CreateFulfillmentOrderItem[]  $items  An array of item information for creating a fulfillment order.
     * @param  ?string  $marketplaceId  The marketplace the fulfillment order is placed against.
     * @param  ?DeliveryWindow  $deliveryWindow  The time range within which a Scheduled Delivery fulfillment order should be delivered. This is only available in the JP marketplace.
     * @param  ?DeliveryPreferences  $deliveryPreferences  The delivery preferences applied to the destination address. These preferences will be applied when possible and are best effort.
     *                                                     This feature is currently supported only in the JP marketplace and not applicable for other marketplaces.
     * @param  ?string  $fulfillmentAction  Specifies whether the fulfillment order should ship now or have an order hold put on it.
     * @param  ?string  $fulfillmentPolicy  The `FulfillmentPolicy` value specified when you submitted the `createFulfillmentOrder` operation.
     * @param  ?CodSettings  $codSettings  The COD (Cash On Delivery) charges that you associate with a COD fulfillment order.
     * @param  ?string  $shipFromCountryCode  The two-character country code for the country from which the fulfillment order ships. Must be in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format.
     * @param  ?string[]  $notificationEmails  A list of email addresses that the seller provides that are used by Amazon to send ship-complete notifications to recipients on behalf of the seller.
     * @param  FeatureSettings[]|null  $featureConstraints  A list of features and their fulfillment policies to apply to the order.
     * @param  PaymentInformation[]|null  $paymentInformation  An array of various payment attributes related to this fulfillment order.
