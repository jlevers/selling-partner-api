```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

$apiInstance = new Evers\SellingPartnerApi\Api\UploadsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client()
);
$marketplace_ids = array("marketplace_ids_example"); // string[] | A list of marketplace identifiers. This specifies the marketplaces where the upload will be available. Only one marketplace can be specified.
$content_md5 = "content_md5_example"; // string | An MD5 hash of the content to be submitted to the upload destination. This value is used to determine if the data has been corrupted or tampered with during transit.
$resource = "resource_example"; // string | The URL of the resource for the upload destination that you are creating. For example, to create an upload destination for a Buyer-Seller Messaging message, the {resource} would be /messaging and the path would be  /uploads/v1/uploadDestinations/messaging
$content_type = "content_type_example"; // string | The content type of the file to be uploaded.
