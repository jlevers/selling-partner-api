     *
     * - `BLOCK_AMZL`: Blocks orders from being shipped using Amazon Logistics (AMZL).
     *   - Note: Using this feature will incur additional fee surcharges on MCF orders and may increase the risk of unfulfilled or delayed deliveries if alternative carriers are unavailable. Using `BLOCK_AMZL` in an order request will take precedence over your Seller Central account setting.
     * - `BLANK_BOX`: Ships orders in non-Amazon branded packaging (blank boxes).
     * - `SIGNATURE_CONFIRMATION`: Requires a signature from the recipient upon delivery.
     *   - Note: Using signature confirmation features will incur additional fees on MCF orders and are currently supported only in the US marketplace.
     * @param  ?string  $featureFulfillmentPolicy  Specifies the policy to use when fulfilling an order.
